# SpeechT5 TTS Fine-Tuning for Technical Terms

This repository contains code, models, and documentation for fine-tuning SpeechT5, a Text-to-Speech (TTS) model, for improved pronunciation of domain-specific technical terms. The goal is to enhance the model’s ability to synthesize accurate and natural-sounding speech for specialized fields such as science, engineering, and medicine.

### Overview

This project builds on Microsoft’s SpeechT5 model by fine-tuning it for Text-to-Speech tasks involving technical jargon. The motivation is to ensure proper pronunciation and fluency of terms that are often mispronounced or synthesized incorrectly by general-purpose models.

### Steps and Installation
1. You can easily download the files uploaded in this repository which has .ipynb files which contains the code and can be easily run inorder to get the output.
2. You can also check up and download the model from HuggingFace: https://huggingface.co/Niha14/speecht5_finetuned_techincal_data
